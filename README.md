## Linear Regress to Predict MPG
![Linear Regression Output](mpg_linear_regression_output.png)

Assuming a standard significance level, vehicle length, and ground clearance are unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to mpg values and are therefore likely to have significant impact. 

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
